### Lesson Overview

The terms scalability and high availability have never been more popular due to the rising requirement for dependable and effective infrastructures built to support important systems. Reducing downtime and removing single points of failure are equally crucial, even if managing increased system load is a regular worry. Scalable infrastructure designs that prioritize high availability take these latter factors into account.

In this lesson, it will explore more what exactly high availability means and how it can improve the infrastructureâ€™s reliability.

## Part 1 - High Availability

The term "availability" in computing refers to both the amount of time that a service is accessible and the amount of time it takes for a system to react to a user's request. A system or component's high availability refers to a property that guarantees a high level of operational performance for a specific amount of time.

A value of 100% would mean that the system never fails. Availability is frequently expressed as a percentage indicating how much uptime is expected from a specific system or component in a given period of time. For instance, a system that promises 99% uptime over the course of a year may have up to 3.65 days of outage (1%).

These figures are determined by a number of variables, such as planned and unforeseen maintenance intervals, as well as the amount of time needed to recover from a potential system failure.

**Why Is High Availability Important?**

Whatever the cause, downtime can have a very negative impact on the health of your company. As a result, IT staff continuously work to implement appropriate methods to reduce downtime and guarantee continual system availability. Downtime can have a negative effect in a variety of ways, including missed productivity, lost business opportunities, lost data, and impaired brand reputation.

As a result, the expenditures related to downtime might cause anything from a little budget imbalance to a significant hole in your wallet. High availability is necessary for a number of reasons, but one of them is to prevent downtime. Several additional factors include:


**1. Maintaining your SLAs**

For MSPs to guarantee the delivery of high-quality services to their clients, maintaining uptime is a crucial requirement. High-availability systems enable MSPs to consistently meet their SLAs and guarantee that their clients' networks don't go down.

**2. Customers Relation**

Customers that experience frequent business interruptions due to outages may get dissatisfied. High-availability environments minimize the possibility of future downtime and can assist MSPs in establishing enduring connections with clients by ensuring their satisfaction.


**3. Company Reputation** -

System availability is a crucial sign of how well your services are delivered. Because of this, MSPs can use high-availability environments to preserve system uptime and establish a solid brand identity in the marketplace.

**4. Data Security**

You may considerably lower the likelihood that your crucial business data will be improperly accessed or stolen by decreasing the occurrence of system downtime through high availability.
